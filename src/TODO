How to run the environment:
  Personally I use VSCode --> https://code.visualstudio.com/download
  I can roughly help set up your environment after this step.



Images:
- a lot of images need to be updated
  - Project images
    - Main picture to kind of gather the gist of the project from a glance (viewable on main page)
    - 3 pictures that relate to your project

  - Self portrait???
    - I used illustrator and traced the image of me as black and white, deleted the white in photoshop and 
      then changed the color to something else
    - You don't need this if you don't want but it's cool
  
  - These images need to be placed inside the images folder, and then in index.js --> import <insert_name> from '<file_name.png>'; 
    then add the <insert_name> to the export list

Information: 
  I tried to mark spots that need changing
  For example:
    - Resume.js
      - update the import
      - update the file used inside the function
    - GetProject.js 
      - contains your onepagers, you will need to make them here. 
      - This should happen after having images
    - GetRoutes.js 
      - I would start adding an empty function to GetProject.js and then add the import to GetRoutes and change the path/function name
      - You will not be able to see your one pager until GetRoutes is updated.
    - NewMainPage.css
      - colors will need to be updated
    - NewMainPage.js
      - some hardcoded info will need to be added 
      - need an updated resume in jpg form, linkedin link, and some blurb

    - Hamburger.js 
      - last 
      - link updates
    - Projects.js 
      - also happens last
      - Updating pictures, links, and names

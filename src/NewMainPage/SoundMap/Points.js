I really enjoyed listening to the birds, and it's funny because I thought to myself \"I could make an Equalizer to filter out that annoying filler of noise to isolate the sounds I hear,\" and then I realized that the purpose is to showcase the noise and how it impacts the auditory experience as a whole. So yes, I can still hear the highway, unfortunately.",

    text: "At 0.53 miles from the highway, I was at a busy location, the sculpture garden. Plenty of people walked by me, and I had to pretend like I wasn't recording them, even though I was, but I had no plan on keeping their sounds. Regardless, there's still that frequency of sound that I would edit out if I wasn't recording for the purpose of recording the entirety of the sounds. Because of this, I still think I hear the highway. I'm not completely sure, but even if I wasn't I can say that getting a clean recording at all is difficult because of all the vehicles passing by.",

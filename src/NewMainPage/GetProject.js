      "My main job was creating the housing unit in Fusion360 to account for wires, electronics, sensors, as well as creating ways for water to be detected on all 4 sides. The device worked by having conductivity sensors, so when measuring the conductivity, a high value meant water. Because we separated each sensor by 1 cm in height, this allowed us to read the water level to the centimeter. We sent a boolean array representative of each sensor to The Things Network, which allowed a webpage to read off and display points on a map relative to each device's water level. Through a short bit of JavaScript, the array was translated into events, water level, and the battery level of the device in millivolts.",
      " This information was then accessed by a webpage, which displayed the sensors at their respective locations and indicated their water level visually on the map. In later stages of this project, we began using ReactJS to represent our sensors on a map. Throughout this project, I learned the basics of Web Development using ReactJS and how to effectively prototype with an end goal in mind.",

      "Using ReactJS and NodeJS ensured for a database and efficient communication between the server and the client, which is crucial when users rely on the permissions set by the system. Other than transferring over data and making sure that machines could be toggled on and off, one major problem that needed to be solved was adding users.Before, users would be manually added to the system through the use of a database on a raspberry pi. Our goal for this project was to surpass this level of maintanability, so we created a page dedicated to adding users. The page is extremely easy to use, requiring a Fabrication Technician's ID as well as the new card ID. The new user has to also input some additional information, and if any slot is left out, a warning pops up beside the input box. Through the use of this page, a new user is added to the system immediately, and this can be reflected by tapping the RFID card on a reader, presenting the user's name.",
      "A large part of the MakerSpace is user independence, and part of this is training users to use certain machines and tools. Therefore, users need to be able to have trainings added, so that the system permits them to use the machines. I created the page to edit a user's training by first presenting a login page, which will only allow Fabrication Technicians or Administrators to access the edit page. Once a username is typed in, the user's trainings will appear. I decided to use a checkbox system to represent trainings as it's simple and represents exactly what is needed. Additionally, only Administrators will be able to see the \"FabTech\" Box. This software is currently in use at the Tulane MakerSpace, increasing the efficiency and user independence.",

I then took the top 10 favorite artists and found their 20 related artists each. Because some artists could have the same related artist, I reduced the results by name and summed their weighting based on their root artist's ranking, making a more often appearing artist have a higher value. Another problem is that the user might already be listening to these related artists, so I filtered out the top 40 artists as well as the artists of their top 50 tracks. For the sorted and weighted recommended artists, I displayed the top 20 and embedded their top track next to them.",

I plan to submit this application for Spotify's review to officially publish it and have it open for other users, but I have successfully found new artists that are making their way into my playlists! I consider this application a huge success because I'm both proud of it, and it's something I find super useful.",

We will be coating the PCB to prevent water or corrosion, and we will be 3D printing an enclosure.

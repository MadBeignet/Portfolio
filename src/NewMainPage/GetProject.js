The device worked by having conductivity sensors, so when measuring the conductivity, a high value meant water. Because we separated each sensor by 1 cm in height, this allowed us to read the water level to the centimeter. We sent a boolean array representative of each sensor to The Things Network, which allowed a webpage to read off and display points on a map relative to each device's water level. Through a short bit of JavaScript, the array was translated into events, water level, and the battery level of the device in millivolts.",
      " This information was then accessed by a webpage, which displayed the sensors at their respective locations and indicated their water level visually on the map. In later stages of this project, we began using ReactJS to represent our sensors on a map. Throughout this project, I learned the basics of Web Development using ReactJS and how to effectively prototype with an end goal in mind.",

Other than transferring over data and making sure that machines could be toggled on and off, one major problem that needed to be solved was adding users.Before, users would be manually added to the system through the use of a database on a raspberry pi. Our goal for this project was to surpass this level of maintanability, so we created a page dedicated to adding users. The page is extremely easy to use, requiring a Fabrication Technician's ID as well as the new card ID. The new user has to also input some additional information, and if any slot is left out, a warning pops up beside the input box. Through the use of this page, a new user is added to the system immediately, and this can be reflected by tapping the RFID card on a reader, presenting the user's name.",
      "A large part of the MakerSpace is user independence, and part of this is training users to use certain machines and tools. Therefore, users need to be able to have trainings added, so that the system permits them to use the machines. I created the page to edit a user's training by first presenting a login page, which will only allow Fabrication Technicians or Administrators to access the edit page. Once a username is typed in, the user's trainings will appear. I decided to use a checkbox system to represent trainings as it's simple and represents exactly what is needed. Additionally, only Administrators will be able to see the \"FabTech\" Box. This software is currently in use at the Tulane MakerSpace, increasing the efficiency and user independence.",

Because some artists could have the same related artist, I reduced the results by name and summed their weighting based on their root artist's ranking, making a more often appearing artist have a higher value. Another problem is that the user might already be listening to these related artists, so I filtered out the top 40 artists as well as the artists of their top 50 tracks. For the sorted and weighted recommended artists, I displayed the top 20 and embedded their top track next to them.",

The reasoning for this is to focus on the power system, and this ended up benefitting us because there was an error. Because we were essentially recreating an Arduino board from scratch, this was unfamiliar, and we messed up the system that allows the board to actually take in code. That being said, the team member who designed these boards immediately researched on the topic and dove right in with a multimeter and a soldering iron to modify the board enough to test the full power system. This was crucial because even though the board had errors, we were able to not only learn what the errors were, but also ensure that the solution would allow the board to work.",
          "For the second PCB, sensors were included on the board, such as an HDC1080 temperature and humidity sensor, a slot for a photoresistor to detect light, and the custom frequency soil moisture sensor. The board also changed shape, now reflecting the shape drawn above, with 30cm at its widest point and being about 180cm tall. This board also had some issues caused by the software used to create them, but that problem, like the previous problems, were solved by digging into the board and manually redirecting power. This solution allowed us to test solar charging with our current buck converter and battery as well as create code that reads the frequency-based soil moisture sensor. Another feature on this board is a power rail, which is enabled only when taking readings. This allows us to not waste power on sensors that remain in a sleep mode, which remains drawing power from our system. Doing so effectively saves us 12mAh of 26mAh of power per day, nearly eliminating half of the original power. Overall, we're making huge progress on this project, and I'm incredibly excited to see how our device progresses next semester.",

          "Throughout the first semester, we realized a few problems. Because this device will be outdoors for its lifetime, it will need to be as weather proof as possible. This doesn't just mean the PCB, but also the enclosure. To solve this problem, I designed a enclosure fitted to the PCB design to allow for a neoprene layer between. This will ensure that the enclosure is as waterproof as possible without being airtight. This is because our sensors still need to access to air to take data points, such as humidity. For this issue specifically, we are using an expanded teflon mesh, which will allow airflow and moisture, but not water at low pressures. This solution has yet to be tested, but we are confident that it will work.",
          "Another problem we realized related to charging. For instance, our current battery is an LIR2032 40mAh coin cell battery, which we calculated as having a lifetime without charge for 2.7 days. The charging issue isn't caused by the battery capacity, but actually by the charger/buck converter because the minimum applied voltage has to be between 4.2V and 6.4V. Our solar panel is capable up to 5.58V, but we found that the panel struggles on overcast days. It's unlikely that this problem is able to be solved by just getting a battery with much larger capacity because that's not the issue, but exchanging the buck converter or the solar panel will cost a lot more money, upwards of $400. With our $3,000 budget already being flexed, we are trying to find a solution that works for our device, budget, and our product receiver, FCAT.",

The second panel had a more similar footprint to the current panel, but later I discovered they were out of stock. It was a go for panel #1 with 2.23V and 55mA. But at just over $4 a panel, it was going to take money. However with that money, we gained confidence in our device. For the associated buck converter, we would have to go with the 0.1V to 3.0V converter because of supply-chain issues. It is clear that switching solar panels is advantageous because of its nearly quadrupled charging speed. Because we also switched our battery to a JST connector, we saved $100 total, spending $250 net.",

At each measurement, the node would store and then go back to sleep for the remaining time until the next wakeup. On the final measurement of the day (or measurement period), the node would instead go into a wait state while it waited for a message from the gateway. As soon as the gateway sent the message, the node would then broadcast it for other nodes out of range, then the node would wait a random amount of time, send the data to the gateway, and then act as a relay point for other nodes throughout the rest of the time. After this point, the node would go to sleep. The gateway tallies up the measurements and the nodes, and sends it to the web-app to be displayed, also noting any nodes that did not check in."

Therefore, I created a Measurement struct consisting of 20 bytes when compacted. This means up to 12 measurements could be sent in 1 message or measurement period. To conserve power, the device turns off its accessory rail and goes to sleep. This means the process resets, and data stored normally while awake also resets.
